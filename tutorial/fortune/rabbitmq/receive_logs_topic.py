# Deklare exchange.
# Receives messages from producers and pushes them to queues.
# Must know exactly what to do with a received message (e.g. discard it or append it
# to particular queue or many queues), those rules are defined by the exchange type.
# (Available exchange types: 'direct', 'topic', 'headers' and 'fanout'.)
channel.exchange_declare(exchange='topic_logs',  # Define name of exchange.
                         exchange_type='topic')  # This type broadcasts a message to all
# queues whose binding key (routing_key
# in channel.queue_bind()) matches the
# routing key of the message. Important
# special cases for binding keys:
# '*' can substitute for exactly one word.
# '#' can substitute for zero or more words.
# (So a queue with '#' as binding key would
# receive all messages, regardless of the
# routing key - like in fanout exchange.)
# (When the special characters '*' and '#'
# aren't used in bindings, the topic exchange
# will behave just like a direct exchange.)

# Create a fresh, empty queue when the consumer connects to RabbitMQ.
# If no name for queue is specified (like here) the server will choose a random name.
# 'exclusive=True' means the queue will be deleted if the consumer disconnects.
result = channel.queue_declare(exclusive=True)
queue_name = result.method.queue  # Get the random queue name.

# Get binding keys (the consumer will only get logs with a matching routing_key).
# Specify them through '$ python receive_logs_topic.py [binding_key]...' (specify multiple
# binding keys by seperating them with spaces).
# To simplify things we will assume that a binding_key will have two words:
# '<facility>.<severity>'.
# For topic exchanges, binding_keys must be a list of words, delimited by dots.
# The words can be anything, but usually they specify some features connected to the message.
# There can be as many words in the binding key as you like, up to the
# limit of 255 bytes.

                       routing_key=binding_key)  # Define binding key.
    # Its meaning depends on the exchange type.
    # ('topic' exchanges can do routing based on
    # multiple criteria which are defined here.)
